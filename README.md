## FAQ

### Where can I get the latest version?
If you need the latest main branch, you can just [download it here directly from GitHub](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- You can also find [the latest "release" here](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/releases/latest).
  Either way, simply unpack and you should get the TSV files which you can then edit with your favorite editor, spreadsheet tool or IDE and parse in your scripts.

### Why make this repo?
There are various reasons why I started this:
- I needed a convenient way to version, update and manage essential configurations like DNS- & NTP-Servers as well as being able to just simply fetch and apply them when setting up systems, or at the very least just pull the latest version in a script.
- I don't want to constantly copy & paste any current recommendation but have a fixed link to said repo for use on projects and recommendation.
- Others might benefit from sharing said data and being able to contribute too.
  - Please feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/issues) if you have any suggestions, like adding your own data to it
    - Don't forget to provide source links!

### Why use it?
- It just works!
  - Due to using TSV files you can simply pull said lists and query them with any tool that can handle plaintext.
    - [from pfBlockerNG](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1564055009762967555) and a lot of CLI / TUI tools and scrips to even GUI-based spreadsheet programs like LibreOffice Calc...
- Because it's well-maintained and documented.
  - Suggestions and Reports of Issues are welcome.
- It's increasing adoption already works.
  - See [#DropKiwifarms](https://twitter.com/k3vk4/status/1562956359686971392)
- It's being used by several companies internally.
  - Due to NDAs we can't list them here, unfortunately.
    - But it's part of the toolkit of many people - both contributors and non-contributors.

2. The [Issue](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/issues?q=is%3Aissue) / [Pull Request](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/pulls?q=is%3Apr+) it was submitted with.
3. Evidence of Ownership or Authorization by the Owner of said Domain / IP Adress Space / ASN / ... to act on their behalf.
   - This MUST be verifyable!
4. Proof that the reason for the listing has been removed / corrected.

###### Please allow us time for due diligence and processing of your request.
##### We will not accept other channels for submissions!
###
#### But, but I want it removed NOW!
Please be reminded that we operate on transparency, accountability and consequences and do think that doing the correct thing is better than doing things fast.
##### Whilst our decision may not be final forever, [as we do acknowledge that we ain't perfect](https://github.com/greyhat-academy/lists.d/issues/17), we will take action against spammers flooding our queue and [will publicly ban them](users.github.block.list.tsv).
